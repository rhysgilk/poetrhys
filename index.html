                    <h1>washed away</h1>
                    <p>
i started doing a skin care routine each night<br>
wash my face<br>
cleanse my scalp<br>
lotion, moisturizer<br>
eye cream, face mist<br>
and from that moment, i keep my glasses off<br>
and lay on the bed<br>
with my dimmable lights on low<br>
and let the cool amber fog<br>
creep into the corners of my room<br>
just barely strong enough to lift up<br>
the dark light settling in<br>
and my fan is also set to low<br>
which brings life to a gentle manatee<br>
gliding across my sheets<br>
and caressing my arms and waist<br>
she hums a familiar song whose melody<br>
push and pull the fabric of the room<br>
and stretch at the hem<br>
when was the last time you paused life<br>
and started ripping away at the fabric<br>
this little Wind did<br>
and the manatee got away<br>

                    <h1>a room so overgrown it became a jungle</h1>
                    <p>
i covered my wall with vines<br>
and arranged orchids and thistles<br>
and pinks ones i don’t remember the names of<br>
albeit artificial, both vines and perennials<br>
when i glance past my desk and out the glazed glass<br>
—shattered towards the right<br>
from when i tried to wash away the stains—<br>
and green fills my peripheral<br>
i feel like i’m in the rainforest<br>
and i turn on my fan to a low speed<br>
to feel the breeze graze my neck<br>
and even my little hairs start to sway<br>
as they bask and they breath<br>
<br>
i only chose to install the curtains recently<br>
to block out the moon’s glow while i sleep<br>
although i have no trouble switching with<br>
such a glow in my eyes<br>
and i have an eye mask if needed<br>
rather, to preserve my vast planetarium<br>
and its wonders and smells and hues<br>
<br>
all of my furniture this time around is made from<br>
light woods—oak, pine, maple<br>
and white accents with lamps<br>
and drawers and bookshelves with more foliage<br>
at this point i wonder if i<br>
should just break the whole window<br>
who needs inside or out<br>
there shouldn’t be sides at all<br>
just the Wind dancing as she pleases<br>
and her audience admiring her gown

carried from bank and bending<br>
to ride on the rolling roar<br>
rocked by the river rapids<br>
and kissed by the jagged floor<br>
<br>
chaos brought forth by nature<br>
for means of travel merry<br>
magic as nymph or pixie<br>
that’s why it’s called a ferry

today i became a moth<br>
i shed my old skin and left it behind<br>
what lies between the broken walls<br>
and under the falling stars<br>
my old hopes and dreams<br>
hidden from those who didn’t believe<br>
and thus hidden from myself<br>
but i carry a map, mostly unmarked<br>
should i decide to return

everything is born from darkness<br>
which stretches into the great beyond indefinitely<br>
until a singular point dots that infinite canvas<br>
beginning a chain reaction of<br>
unrelenting blasts of shimmering wonder<br>
a depth of anecdotes and ideas<br>
piercing from that smoke covered cloak<br>
reaching our eyes<br>
glittered grey of billions of sparkling stories<br>
our eyes must pick and choose<br>
which not to ignore<br>
as too much color and too much light<br>
may lead to a blind eye<br>
and as the explosions fade into time<br>
we are left with the after light<br>
shadows etched into the memories of our eyes<br>
which continue to imagine<br>
the stories beyond the end<br>
falling down past the horizon<br>
and dying the the ground from which she came

the difference between humans and fairies<br>
is that humans take from this planet<br>
while fairies give back to it<br>
<br>
that must be why we can’t see them anymore<br>
i don’t blame them for hiding from us<br>
so that we may not steal their magic

i didn’t used to like the beach<br>
the sun burned my eyes<br>
and the sand burned my soles<br>
<br>
the coast hides sharp rocks<br>
and seaweed tangles and enwraps your limbs<br>
dragging you down and in with the tide<br>
and unlike the other kids,<br>
i was afraid to breath under water<br>
because when the salt touched my nose<br>
i felt like a boiling quahog<br>
<br>
i didn’t like how many people were there<br>
and how people stared<br>
and i didn’t like my body<br>
<br>
and somehow<br>
no matter how diligently you rinse off<br>
before getting in the car<br>
sand finds its way back home and settles<br>
into the carpet threads or under the baseboards<br>
awaiting a meal or the heating to turn on<br>
to keep warm<br>
it misses the ocean and the seagulls and the shells<br>
<br>
nowadays i like to lay in the Wind<br>
and listen to the sand tell me<br>
thousands of stories in its thousands of lifetimes

she told me how she loves spring<br>
and how much she loves the sun<br>
and the shade from a great wind tree<br>
and the night time<br>
and the days in between<br>
how she loved thursdays because that’s when<br>
the children come skipping around<br>
with their little metal lunch boxes<br>
filled with juices and apple slices<br>
and cheese and carrots and sometimes<br>
yogurt and sometimes crackers<br>
and they all sit down on the fresh mulch<br>
and devour their little lunches<br>
she loves the bees<br>
and even though i do not care for them<br>
i will try to since she insists that their wings<br>
create music that puts her to sleep<br>
and the pollen they carry smell like<br>
fields of mowed grass and dew<br>
and they give life to all most importantly<br>
i wish i could see the life from your bud

just how many stars are in the sky<br>
is not something i thought before that night<br>
when i laid in the wild grass and let my body<br>
be a beacon for not just ants and mosquitos<br>
<br>
between the shutter of my eyelids<br>
i let whatever wonders of life that we call light<br>
reach my eyes and sketch their stories onto mine<br>
while damp ground beneath me absorbed my shell<br>
<br>
i faltered not whilst beholding<br>
each and every delight i could catch<br>
with my eyelashes and pray<br>
that they won’t escape<br>
<br>
i thought back to the last time i thunk<br>
and could not recall a time where the only axiom<br>
was one life with infinite pleasure that has been<br>
split and divided amongst the cosmos<br>
<br>
but in those moments as my soiled body<br>
was drained of nutrients<br>
i transaw a network of life<br>
and became a beacon of light
